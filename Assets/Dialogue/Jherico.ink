Greetings, want to know more about the Memory Chip material for your RAM? {player_Name} #speaker: Jherico #portrait: 25

    * Yes #speaker: {player_Name} #portrait: 0
        Memory Chip can be obtained when defeating enemies in this world. #speaker: Jherico #portrait: 25
        The memory chips used in RAM (Random Access Memory) are primarily made from materials optimized for storing and processing digital information at high speeds. #speaker: Jherico #portrait: 25
        The core component of a memory chip is the semiconductor, typically made of silicon which serves as the primary material for all modern integrated circuits, just like RAM chips. #speaker: Jherico #portrait: 25
        Other than the different types of Silicon like, Doped Silicon, Polysilicon, and Silicon Dioxide. #speaker: Jherico #portrait: 25
        It also contains Metal and Passivation Layers, Dielectric, Photoresist, Packaging, and Conductive Materials. #speaker: Jherico #portrait: 25
        This makes RAM handle high-speed data transfers efficiently and reliably. #speaker: Jherico #portrait: 25
        Just like CPU. #speaker: {player_Name} #portrait: 0
        Yes, because both of them have integrated circuit. speaker: Jherico #portrait: 25
        Got it, Thanks. #speaker: {player_Name} #portrait: 0
        I appreciate your cooperation. Take care on your adventure. speaker: Jherico #portrait: 25
