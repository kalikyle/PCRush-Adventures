        Sure! The case is the outer shell of your computer. It holds all the components together and protects them from dust and damage. #speaker: Joseph #portrait: 36
        A good case also helps with airflow, keeping your system cool while it runs. #speaker: Joseph #portrait: 36
        Without a sturdy case, your components could be vulnerable to wear and tear! #speaker: Joseph #portrait: 36
