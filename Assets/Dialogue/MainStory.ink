ahh ok, to unlock those regions, you need to become stronger too #speaker: CPUExchanger #portrait: 4
and as you fight the bad creatures and collect thier materials, you can also exchange that materials to the exchangers of the regions #speaker: CPUExchanger #portrait: 4
and they will give you the computer part that you want #speaker: CPUExchanger #portrait: 4
So, I need to become stronger and stronger to unlock those regions why?  #speaker: {player_Name} #portrait: 0
I fought the bad creatures here but they are weak do I need to be stronger? #speaker: {player_Name} #portrait: 0
Yes, as you progress on unlocking those regions enemies are getting stronger and faster too #speaker: CPUExchanger #portrait: 4
the most stronger enemies are in the case region, they are elites and you need to fought them for us to fully functional again #speaker: CPUExchanger #portrait: 4
Ok, I see #speaker: {player_Name} #portrait: 0
You need to buy powerful swords, armor, shield and helmet specially the computer parts that we exchange for you #speaker: CPUExchanger #portrait: 4
those computer parts are not just computer parts they make you also more stronger because of the perks it have #speaker: CPUExchanger #portrait: 4
