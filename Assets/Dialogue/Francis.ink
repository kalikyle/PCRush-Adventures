        Alright. A CPU fan is an essential component of a computer's cooling system designed to keep the Central Processing Unit (CPU) cool during operation.	#speaker: Francis #portrait: 27
        There are 3 types of CPU Cooling and those are: Air Cooling, Liquid Cooling also known as AIO Cooling or All-in-One Cooling, and last was the Custom Water Cooling. #speaker: Francis #portrait: 27
        Air Cooling is the most common cooling method for CPUs, air cooling uses a fan to blow air over the heatsink to dissipate heat. #speaker: Francis #portrait: 27
        Liquid cooling uses water or a coolant to absorb heat from the CPU, transferring it through tubes to a radiator where fans expel the heat. #speaker: Francis #portrait: 27
        An advanced cooling solution that involves custom-designed loops of tubing, reservoirs, and pumps to cool not only the CPU but also other components like the GPU and motherboard. #speaker: Francis #portrait: 27
