        Okay. RAM, also known as Random Access Memory, is a type of computer memory that temporarily stores data that the CPU needs to access quickly while a computer is running. #speaker: Arjhay #portrait: 24
        It is a critical component in determining the performance of a computer, as it holds the data and instructions for currently running programs and processes. #speaker: Arjhay #portrait: 24
        It is volatile memory, meaning that it only holds data while the computer is powered on. Once the computer is turned off, all of its data is lost. #speaker: Arjhay #portrait: 24
        Unlike other storage types like hard drives, RAM allows data to be read and written in any order (random access). #speaker: Arjhay #portrait: 24
        That results in making it much faster for the CPU to retrieve data from RAM than from other types of storage. #speaker: Arjhay #portrait: 24
        Now you know more about RAM. #speaker: Arjhay #portrait: 24
